It leverages advanced technologies and digital solutions to create a connected and efficient living environment for residents, enabling them to actively participate in community affairs and access various services conveniently.

PROPOSED SYSTEM

1.	Resident Profiles:
The Smart Society Portal allows residents to create and manage their personal profiles. They can provide relevant information such as contact details, emergency contacts, and preferences. The profiles serve as a means of identification and enable personalized interactions within the system.
2.	Online Payment:
The system provides a secure online payment gateway for residents to make maintenance fee payments, utility bill payments, and other dues. Residents can easily view their pending payments, choose payment methods, and receive payment receipts for their records.
3.	Facility Booking:
Residents can check the availability of various society facilities, such as clubhouses, swimming pools, gyms, and sports courts, through the portal. They can then make online bookings for specific time slots, eliminating the need for manual bookings or coordination.
4.	Visitor Management:
The Smart Society Portal introduces an efficient visitor management system. Residents can pre-register their guests, including friends, relatives, or service providers, and generate digital visitor passes. The system tracks the entry and exit of visitors, enhancing security and enabling easy monitoring.
5.	Notice Board:
The system incorporates an interactive notice board that serves as a central hub for society-wide announcements, events, and important information. Residents can access the notice board to stay informed about upcoming activities, policy changes, and community initiatives.
